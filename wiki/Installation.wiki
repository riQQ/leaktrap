#summary Setup instructions.

 * Download [http://research.microsoft.com/sn/detours/ Detours library], follow the readme steps to build it (at least you will need the import library `detours.lib`, the detoured indicator `detoured.dll` and the `setdll` example compiled.)
 * You could also compile the leaktrap project (the VC71 project file is inside the source code distribution) -> `leaktrap_vc71.dll`
 * You could also compile the leakdbg debugger extension (Windows DDK makefile is inside the source code distribution) -> `leakdbg.dll`
 * Alternatively simply grab the binary distribution, which has been compiled using the Visual Studio 2003 (`leaktrap_vc71.dll`) and DDK version 1.1.6001.000 (`leakdbg.dll`) plus additional binary extras archive that contains the vc71 runtime libraries and precompiled detours binaries
 * Copy `leaktrap_vc71.dll`, `leaktrap_vc71.pdb` (<b>very important for debugger extension to work</b>!!), `detoured.dll`, and `setdll.exe` to the folder of your choice (usually the binary folder for your application).
 * Configure your application's executable to load the leaktrap client library by binding it as its first import:
  {{{
  setdll.exe /d:LeakTrap_vc71.dll yourapp.exe
  }}}
 * Make sure you have the [http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/installx86.mspx Windows Debugging Tools package]
 * Copy `leakdbg.dll` to your Windows Debugging Tools package's extensions folder (usually winxp, for windows xp systems and later)
 * If you're getting `LoadLibrary(leakdbg) failed. Win32 error 0n2` errors in debugger, you need to fix the extension path:
  {{{
  .extpath+ path_to_leakdbg.dll
  }}}
 * Fix the path to your application's pdb files by issuing:
  {{{
  .sympath+ path_to_pdb_files
  .reload
  }}}
 prior to using the leak tracker. If you're not sure which modules you need .pdb files for, watch out for debugger messages:
  {{{
*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.  Defaulted to export symbols for C:\blah-blah\yourmodule1.dll -
  }}}
 Once you know the name of the module, fix its symbols:
  {{{
  .sympath+ path_to_yourmodule1.pdb
  .reload /f yourmodule1.dll
  }}}
 * *You're all set*

Any time an exported (system) API that is to be detoured is not found or stack capture routine is not available, the client library will return `FALSE` from its `DllMain` thus failing the complete application initialization.

System requirements:
 * Windows XP and later (since it relies on a system stack capture routine available in Windows XP - _it could be written manually though and thus made available to w2k_)
 * Since the client library has been compiled with VC71, its runtime is also a requirement (msvcr71.dll + msvcp71.dll) (if you do not have vc71 runtime, download bin_extras archive from Downloads section!)
 * The library reportedly *does not* work under Windows 7 and I still do not have a Windows 7 system to test ;o(

*Important*
 You need to have proper .pdb files for all modules you're inspecting for resource leaks. It is also important that these modules be compiled without frame pointer optimizations (*-Oy-* switch for visual studio) as the used stack trace routine is very simple and relies solely on proper function frames to walk the stack!
